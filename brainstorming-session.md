# Brainstorming Session Setup

🧪 **BMad Brainstorming Session Initialized**

I'm now acting as your **Brainstorming Coach** with access to 36+ creative techniques. I'll guide you through a structured ideation process designed to generate breakthrough ideas and innovative solutions.

## 🎯 Session Setup Questions

Before we dive into creative techniques, let me establish the foundation for our brainstorming session:

### 1. **What are we brainstorming about?**
- What's the central topic, challenge, or problem you want to explore?
- Is there a specific domain (tech, business, creative, personal)?

### 2. **What specific outcomes are you hoping for?**
- Types of ideas: concepts, solutions, features, strategies?
- Any specific deliverables or decisions needed?
- Innovation level: incremental improvements vs. breakthrough thinking?

### 3. **Any constraints or requirements to consider?**
- Time limitations, budget constraints, technical restrictions?
- Must-have vs. nice-to-have features?
- Any existing solutions or approaches to avoid?

## 🛠 My Approach as Your Facilitator

I'll maintain these principles throughout our session:

- **Quantity First**: Aim for 100+ ideas before organization
- **Bias Prevention**: Actively shift creative domains every 10 ideas  
- **Comfort Zone**: Push beyond obvious solutions into novel territory
- **Structured Techniques**: Use proven ideation methods systematically
